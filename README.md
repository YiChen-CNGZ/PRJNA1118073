English: This project is the source code for RNA seq, which was sequenced on a cloud platform (www.majobio. com) and can be used for data learning or replication, but cannot be used for commercial purposes.
The name of the project is simply the NCBI SRA project of the same name, and NCBI has uploaded the original sequence. In brief, a hyperoxia experiment was carried out in this project. The species was turbot with an avarage initial weight is 6 g. NF was the control group and HF was the experimental group.

中文：该项目是RNA-seq的源代码，测序由云平台（www.majorbio.com）完成，可用于数据学习或复现，但不可用于商业目的。项目的名称即是NCBI的同名SRA项目，NCBI已经上传了原始序列。简言之，本项目是进行了一个高氧实验，物种是大菱鲆，初始体重6g左右。NF为对照组，HF为实验组。
